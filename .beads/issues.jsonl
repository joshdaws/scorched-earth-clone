Split it. \"Implement all weapons\" → one issue per weapon\n   - Example issues under Core Game Engine:\n     - \"Create game loop and state machine\"\n     - \"Implement turn system\"\n     - \"Add projectile trajectory calculation\"\n     - \"Implement terrain heightmap data structure\"\n     - \"Add terrain rendering\"\n     - \"Implement collision detection\"\n     - \"Add terrain destruction\"\n\n4. **CRITICAL: Set dependencies correctly:**\n   - ALL implementation issues must include: `--deps \"blocks:scorched-earth-7ku\"`\n   - This ensures tech stack is done first\n   - Also set logical dependencies (terrain rendering blocks terrain destruction)\n\n5. **Write good acceptance criteria for EACH issue:**\n   ```bash\n   bd create --title \"Implement basic projectile physics\" \\\n     --type task \\\n     --parent \u003cepic-id\u003e \\\n     --deps \"blocks:scorched-earth-7ku\" \\\n     --acceptance \"## Acceptance Criteria\n   - [ ] Projectile spawns at tank barrel position\n   - [ ] Follows parabolic arc based on angle and power\n   - [ ] Affected by gravity constant\n   - [ ] Affected by wind value\n   - [ ] Trajectory visually matches expected physics\n   - [ ] Console shows no errors\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Prioritize logically:**\n   - Foundation first (game loop, rendering, physics)\n   - Then features (weapons, AI)\n   - Then polish (effects, audio, UI)\n\n7. **Document the structure** - Update CLAUDE.md \"Current Status\" section with the epic breakdown","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create epics for major feature areas (Core Engine, Weapons, AI, UI, Audio, etc.)\n- [ ] Break each epic into implementable issues\n- [ ] Each issue has clear, testable acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Issues are properly sized for Ralph (one issue = one iteration)\n- [ ] Dependencies between issues are documented\n- [ ] All issues link back to parent epics\n- [ ] **CRITICAL: ALL implementation issues must be blocked by scorched-earth-7ku (tech stack epic)**\n- [ ] No implementation work can start until tech stack is complete\n\nThis ensures tech stack is fully set up before any game code is written.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T16:25:16.45347-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws","updated_at":"2026-01-08T17:06:20.223273-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"scorched-earth-28e","depends_on_id":"scorched-earth-33s","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T16:25:16.454326-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws"}]}
