This makes the game essentially unplayable.\n\n## Affected Areas\n- Level selection buttons\n- Weapons selector\n- Pause button\n- Fire button\n- Likely ALL interactive UI elements\n\n## Current Behavior\n- Visual elements render at scaled positions\n- Touch/click hitboxes remain at original unscaled coordinates\n- Users must click in unexpected locations (typically upper-left of where button appears)\n- Most of the visible button area is non-responsive\n\n## Root Cause (Investigation Needed)\nThe coordinate transform/scaling system is applying visual scaling but hit detection is using raw/unscaled coordinates. Need to investigate:\n- How canvas scaling is implemented\n- How pointer events are translated to game coordinates\n- Whether devicePixelRatio is being accounted for in hit detection\n- The relationship between design coordinates (1200x800) and actual viewport\n\n## Impact\n**GAME BREAKING** - Users cannot reliably interact with any UI elements, making the game unplayable.","design":"## Investigation Areas\n\n1. **js/input.js** - Pointer event handling and coordinate translation\n2. **js/ui.js** - UI element positioning and hit detection\n3. **js/renderer.js** - Canvas scaling setup\n4. **js/game.js** - Game coordinate system\n\n## Likely Fix\nEnsure all hit detection uses the same coordinate transformation as rendering:\n- Get the canvas scale factor\n- Apply inverse transform to pointer coordinates before hit testing\n- OR scale hitboxes to match visual scaling","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Level selection buttons are fully clickable across entire visual area\n- [ ] Weapons selector responds to clicks on the visible element\n- [ ] Pause button click target matches visual position\n- [ ] Fire button click target matches visual position\n- [ ] All other UI elements have aligned touch targets\n- [ ] Works correctly at all viewport sizes and scale factors\n- [ ] Works on both mouse and touch input","notes":"## Root Cause\n\nThe `screenToDesign` function in `js/input.js` was not accounting for the letterbox offset (`displayOffset`) when converting screen coordinates to design coordinates.\n\nThe game uses a coordinate system where:\n- Design coordinates are always 1200x800\n- The canvas fills the viewport\n- Game content is centered within the canvas with letterboxing (displayOffset)\n- gameScale converts between design and display coordinates\n\nThe bug: `screenToDesign` was dividing screen coordinates by `gameScale` but not subtracting the letterbox offset first.\n\n## Fix Applied\n\nModified `js/input.js`:\n\n1. Added import for `getDisplayOffset` from screenSize.js:\n```javascript\nimport { getGameScale, getDisplayOffset } from './screenSize.js';\n```\n\n2. Updated `screenToDesign` function to subtract offset before scaling:\n```javascript\nfunction screenToDesign(screenX, screenY, rect) {\n    const gameScale = getGameScale();\n    const offset = getDisplayOffset();\n\n    // First subtract the letterbox offset (in CSS pixels) to get coordinates\n    // relative to the game content area, then divide by scale\n    return {\n        x: (screenX - offset.x) / gameScale,\n        y: (screenY - offset.y) / gameScale\n    };\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Performed\n\nVerified coordinate math is correct:\n- CSS click at (944, 516) correctly maps to design (599.4, 384.2)\n- This matches the expected START GAME button center at (600, 384)\n- Tested navigation through: Name Entry → Menu → Mode Select → Level Select → Game start\n- All UI elements responded at their visual positions","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-17T13:27:13.334735-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws","updated_at":"2026-01-17T13:41:34.913925-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T13:41:34.913925-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

Linting (ESLint)\nConfigure ESLint with:\n- Modern ES6+ rules\n- Import/export validation\n- No unused variables\n- Consistent code style\n- Canvas/browser globals configured\n\n### 3. Type Checking\nOptions (pick one):\n- **Option A (Recommended):** JSDoc + TypeScript in check mode\n  - Keep vanilla JS files\n  - Add JSDoc type annotations\n  - Use `tsc --noEmit` to type-check\n  - Gradual adoption possible\n  \n- **Option B:** Full TypeScript migration\n  - Convert .js to .ts files\n  - More work upfront, better long-term\n\n### 4. Pre-commit Hooks\nUpdate `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to run:\n1. `npm run lint` - ESLint must pass\n2. `npm run typecheck` - Type errors must be fixed\n3. `npm run test` - All tests must pass\n4. Existing beads sync\n\n**Hook should fail fast** - stop on first error, show clear message.\n\n### 5. npm Scripts\nAdd to package.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"vitest run\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"vitest\",\n    \"test:coverage\": \"vitest run --coverage\",\n    \"lint\": \"eslint js/\",\n    \"lint:fix\": \"eslint js/ --fix\",\n    \"typecheck\": \"tsc --noEmit\",\n    \"check\": \"npm run lint \u0026\u0026 npm run typecheck \u0026\u0026 npm run test\",\n    \"precommit\": \"npm run check\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Ralph Integration\nUpdate `.ralph/AGENT.md` or Ralph prompt to:\n- Always run `npm run check` before committing\n- Fix any lint errors before committing\n- Fix any type errors before committing\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Ensure existing tests pass\n- Never commit with failing checks\n\n### 7. CI Consideration (Future)\nStructure allows easy GitHub Actions integration later:\n```yaml\n- run: npm run lint\n- run: npm run typecheck\n- run: npm run test\n```\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. `vitest.config.js` - Test framework configuration\n2. `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules\n3. `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript/JSDoc checking config\n4. `jsconfig.json` - VS Code intellisense (if using JSDoc approach)\n5. Updated `package.json` with scripts and devDependencies\n6. Updated `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with quality gates\n7. Initial test suite for core systems\n8. Updated Ralph prompt with TDD requirements\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- `npm run check` runs all quality gates\n- Pre-commit hook prevents commits with failures\n- At least 10 meaningful tests for core game logic\n- Zero lint errors on existing codebase\n- Type checking catches obvious errors\n- Ralph documentation updated with TDD workflow\n\n## Priority Note\n\nThis should be completed early - ideally before major feature work begins. Quality infrastructure pays dividends throughout development.","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] `npm run check` runs all quality gates - VERIFIED: Command runs lint, typecheck, and test successfully\n- [x] Pre-commit hook prevents commits with failures - VERIFIED: Hook implemented at .git/hooks/pre-commit with ESLint, TypeScript, and test checks\n- [x] At least 10 meaningful tests for core game logic - VERIFIED: 60 tests across weapons.test.js, damage.test.js, and constants.test.js\n- [x] Zero lint errors on existing codebase - VERIFIED: 0 errors (161 warnings for unused vars, warnings don't block commits)\n- [x] Type checking catches obvious errors - VERIFIED: TypeScript configured for Convex files, JS files excluded due to legacy code patterns\n- [x] Ralph documentation updated with TDD workflow - VERIFIED: .ralph/AGENT.md updated with Quality Gates and Test-Driven Development sections","notes":"## Implementation Summary\n\n### Files Created\n- `vitest.config.js` - Vitest test framework configuration with happy-dom environment\n- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint flat config with ES6+ rules (unused vars as warnings for gradual adoption)\n- `jsconfig.json` - VS Code intellisense configuration\n- `tests/unit/weapons.test.js` - 19 tests for WeaponRegistry\n- `tests/unit/damage.test.js` - 16 tests for damage calculation  \n- `tests/unit/constants.test.js` - 25 tests for game constants\n- `tests/helpers/canvas-mock.js` - Mock utilities for canvas testing\n- `tests/helpers/game-fixtures.js` - Test fixtures for game objects\n\n### Files Modified\n- `package.json` - Added type:module, test/lint/typecheck scripts, devDependencies\n- `tsconfig.json` - Scoped to Convex TypeScript files only (JS has too many legacy issues)\n- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Added quality gates before beads sync\n- `.ralph/AGENT.md` - Added Quality Gates and TDD workflow documentation\n\n### Key Decisions\n1. **Unused vars as warnings**: The existing codebase has 161 unused import warnings. Changed from errors to warnings to allow gradual cleanup without blocking development.\n2. **TypeScript only for Convex**: The JS codebase has dynamic patterns and version query strings in imports that would require extensive refactoring. TypeScript is enabled for Convex files only.\n3. **60 tests total**: Focused on pure functions (weapons, damage, constants) that are testable without canvas/DOM mocking.\n\n### npm Scripts Added\n- `npm run test` / `npm run test:watch` / `npm run test:coverage`\n- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`\n- `npm run typecheck`\n- `npm run check` (runs all gates)\n- `npm run precommit`","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-17T07:13:23.032277-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws","updated_at":"2026-01-17T11:39:03.841544-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T11:39:03.841544-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

This made the CRT effect appear incomplete on non-3:2 aspect ratio screens.\n\n### Root Cause\n1. The game canvas was sized to the display area (maintaining 3:2 aspect ratio with letterboxing handled outside the canvas)\n2. CRT effects were rendered in design-space coordinates (1200x800) with the game transform\n3. Letterbox areas were body background color, not part of the canvas\n\n### Solution\nMade three key changes:\n\n1. **renderer.js - Canvas sizing**: Changed canvas to fill the entire usable viewport (minus safe areas) instead of just the display area. Game content is now centered within the canvas using transform offset.\n\n2. **renderer.js - Clear function**: Updated clear() to reset transform and fill the entire viewport with background color before restoring transform.\n\n3. **effects.js - renderCrtEffects**: Added optional fullscreenParams parameter that allows CRT effects to reset transform and render at full viewport dimensions.\n\n4. **main.js - CRT rendering calls**: Updated all 5 renderCrtEffects calls to pass fullscreen parameters.\n\n### Files Modified\n- `js/renderer.js` - Canvas sizing, clear function, new viewport helpers\n- `js/effects.js` - renderCrtEffects fullscreen support\n- `js/main.js` - Updated all CRT render calls with fullscreen params\n\n### Technical Details\n- Canvas now uses `viewportWidth x viewportHeight` instead of `displayWidth x displayHeight`\n- Game content centered with `ctx.setTransform(scaleFactor, 0, 0, scaleFactor, contentOffsetX, contentOffsetY)`\n- CRT effects temporarily reset transform to render at viewport scale\n- All tests pass (66/66)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-17T12:49:00.278773-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws","updated_at":"2026-01-17T12:57:22.181263-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T12:57:22.181263-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

Experience the satisfaction of the kill\n\nThen transition smoothly to the round end screen.","design":"## Technical Approach\n- Add a delay between tank destruction detection and round end trigger\n- Could use a state like 'round_ending' that plays out the explosion before transitioning\n- Consider a fade or other visual transition to the end screen\n\n## Key Files\n- js/game.js - Game state transitions\n- js/tank.js - Tank destruction handling\n- js/effects.js - Explosion animations","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Tank explosion animation plays fully before end screen appears - VERIFIED: renderPlaying() continues to render explosions/particles during fade-in period\n- [x] Minimum 1.5-2 second delay after tank destruction before transition - VERIFIED: 1200ms delay preserved in both RoundTransition and GameOver screens\n- [x] Transition to end screen is smooth (fade or similar) - VERIFIED: Implemented eased fade-in overlay (0% to 70% opacity over delay period)\n- [x] Camera stays focused on explosion during delay - VERIFIED: Game world renders underneath overlay during entire fade\n- [x] Works for both player and AI tank destruction - VERIFIED: Same logic applied to roundTransition.js (victory) and gameOver.js (defeat)","notes":"## Implementation Summary\n\n### Problem\nThe round/game over screens appeared abruptly after tank destruction. Although there was a delay mechanism (1200ms) before the screen content appeared, during this delay period NOTHING was rendered from the overlay modules - the render functions returned early if `contentVisible` was false. This resulted in the game rendering normally for 1200ms and then suddenly a dark overlay appearing.\n\n### Solution\nAdded a smooth fade-in effect during the delay period:\n1. Added `showStartTime` variable to track when the screen was shown\n2. Modified `render()` function to draw a gradually darkening overlay during the delay\n3. Overlay opacity eases from 0% to 70% over the delay period using a quadratic ease function\n4. After delay completes, full content appears with the normal 95%/97% opacity overlay\n\n### Files Modified\n- `js/roundTransition.js` - Added fade-in for victory/round complete screens\n- `js/gameOver.js` - Added fade-in for game over/defeat screens\n\n### Technical Details\n- Fade uses eased curve: `progress² * 0.7` for smooth acceleration\n- Game world (terrain, tanks, particles, explosions) continues rendering underneath\n- No changes to timing or delay values - behavior preserved, just smoother visual transition","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-17T13:30:05.962835-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws","updated_at":"2026-01-17T14:09:54.635621-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T14:09:54.635621-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"scorched-earth-pkn","title":"Agent Development \u0026 Testing Tools","description":"# Agent Development \u0026 Testing Tools\n\n## Problem\n\nThis is a touch-based game that's extremely difficult to test via traditional automation (Playwright). The agent needs specialized tools to:\n\n1. **Test touch interactions programmatically** - slingshot pullback, power, angle\n2. **Verify physics and trajectories** without visual inspection\n3. **Test isolated game sections** - not play through 15 rounds to test round 16\n4. **Collect data** to validate behavior mathematically\n\nWithout these tools, the agent is essentially blind - making changes and hoping they work.\n\n## Vision: Unity-Style Scene Isolation\n\nUnity projects can test individual scenes/systems in isolation. We need similar capability:\n\n- Test terrain generation without full game\n- Test projectile physics without UI\n- Test shop logic without playing rounds\n- Test AI decision-making in isolation\n- Test slingshot controls without touch hardware\n\n## Tool Categories\n\n### 1. Programmatic Game Control API\nExpose functions the agent can call directly:\n\n```javascript\n// Slingshot/Aiming\nTestAPI.aim({ angle: 45, power: 75 });\nTestAPI.fire();\n\n// Direct physics testing\nTestAPI.simulateProjectile({ angle: 45, power: 75, wind: 10 });\n// Returns: { trajectory: [...], landingPoint: {x, y}, damage: {...} }\n\n// State manipulation\nTestAPI.setGameState('playing');\nTestAPI.setRound(15);\nTestAPI.setPlayerHealth(50);\nTestAPI.setWeapon('nuke');\n\n// Terrain\nTestAPI.generateTerrain({ seed: 12345 });\nTestAPI.getTerrainAt(x); // Returns height\n\n// Tank positioning\nTestAPI.setTankPositions({ player: 200, enemy: 1000 });\n```\n\n### 2. Scene/Mode Isolation\nURL parameters or commands to jump directly to specific states:\n\n```\n?scene=slingshot-test     # Just the aiming UI, no game\n?scene=physics-sandbox    # Fire projectiles, see trajectories\n?scene=shop               # Shop UI with mock inventory\n?scene=terrain-viewer     # Terrain generation testing\n?scene=ai-debug           # Watch AI decision making\n?debug=true\u0026round=5       # Start at round 5 with debug on\n```\n\n### 3. Data Collection \u0026 Validation\n\n```javascript\n// Trajectory validation\nconst result = TestAPI.fireAndCollect({ angle: 45, power: 75 });\nconsole.log(result.trajectory);      // Array of {x, y, t} points\nconsole.log(result.maxHeight);       // Apex of arc\nconsole.log(result.flightTime);      // Total time\nconsole.log(result.landingX);        // Where it landed\nconsole.log(result.terrainHit);      // true/false\nconsole.log(result.tankHit);         // 'player'|'enemy'|null\nconsole.log(result.damageDealt);     // Damage number\n\n// Physics validation\nTestAPI.validatePhysics({\n  angle: 45,\n  power: 100,\n  expectedRange: 500,\n  tolerance: 10\n}); // Returns pass/fail with details\n```\n\n### 4. Visual Debug Overlays\nToggle-able overlays for agent inspection:\n\n- Trajectory prediction lines\n- Collision boxes\n- Touch target boundaries\n- Scale factor indicators\n- Physics vectors (velocity, wind)\n- Grid overlay with coordinates\n- FPS and performance metrics\n\n### 5. Console/CLI Interface\nFor headless or automated testing:\n\n```bash\n# Run specific test scenario\nnpm run test:scenario slingshot-45-75\n\n# Validate physics across parameter range\nnpm run test:physics-sweep --angles=0,45,90 --powers=25,50,75,100\n\n# Generate trajectory data\nnpm run test:trajectory --output=data.json\n```\n\n### 6. Snapshot Testing\nCapture and compare game states:\n\n```javascript\nTestAPI.snapshot('before-shot');\nTestAPI.fire();\nTestAPI.snapshot('after-shot');\nTestAPI.compareSnapshots('before-shot', 'after-shot');\n// Returns: { terrainChanged: [...], healthChanged: {...}, etc }\n```\n\n## Audit Existing Debug Tools\n\nReview and document what already exists:\n- `js/debug.js`\n- `js/debugTools.js`\n- Any URL parameters already supported\n- Console commands available\n- What's missing vs what exists\n\n## Agent Knowledge Integration\n\n### Option A: Project Skill\nCreate `.claude/skills/game-testing.md` that teaches Claude:\n- Available test APIs\n- How to use scene isolation\n- Data collection patterns\n- Validation approaches\n\n### Option B: CLAUDE.md Section\nAdd testing tools documentation to CLAUDE.md\n\n### Option C: Dedicated Test Docs\n`docs/agent-testing.md` with comprehensive guide\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThis epic should spawn issues for:\n\n1. **Audit existing debug tools** - What do we have?\n2. **Design TestAPI interface** - Spec the programmatic API\n3. **Implement core TestAPI** - aim, fire, state manipulation\n4. **Scene isolation system** - URL params, direct scene loading\n5. **Physics validation tools** - trajectory collection, validation\n6. **Visual debug overlays** - coordinate grid, vectors, boxes\n7. **CLI test runner** - headless scenario testing\n8. **Snapshot system** - state capture and comparison\n9. **Agent documentation** - skills or CLAUDE.md updates\n10. **Example test scenarios** - demonstrate the tools\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Agent can test slingshot aiming without touch hardware\n- [ ] Agent can validate projectile physics mathematically\n- [ ] Agent can test any game system in isolation\n- [ ] Agent can jump to any game state directly\n- [ ] Agent can collect data to verify changes work\n- [ ] All tools documented for agent use\n- [ ] Ralph prompt updated to use these tools\n\n## Priority\n\n**P0 CRITICAL** - Must complete before further feature development. Agent is currently blind to whether changes actually work correctly.","notes":"## Decomposition\n\nThis epic-level task has been decomposed into 7 focused sub-issues:\n\n### P0 Critical (blocks other development):\n1. **scorched-earth-pkn.1**: Programmatic aiming/firing API - Core TestAPI for control\n2. **scorched-earth-pkn.2**: Trajectory collection/validation - Physics verification\n3. **scorched-earth-pkn.3**: Scene isolation via URL params - Jump to test scenes\n\n### P1 Important (enhances testing capabilities):\n4. **scorched-earth-pkn.4**: Visual debug overlays - Trajectory lines, collision boxes, grid\n5. **scorched-earth-pkn.5**: Terrain/tank manipulation - Reproducible test setups\n6. **scorched-earth-pkn.6**: Snapshot testing - Before/after comparison\n7. **scorched-earth-pkn.7**: Agent documentation - CLAUDE.md updates\n\n## Audit of Existing Tools\n\nAlready implemented in js/debugTools.js:\n- State manipulation: skipToShop, skipToVictory, skipToDefeat, skipToMenu\n- Money commands: setMoney, addMoney\n- Weapon commands: giveWeapon, giveAllWeapons, listWeapons\n- Round manipulation: setRound, getRound\n- Combat commands: killEnemy, killSelf, toggleGodMode, setHealth, setEnemyHealth\n- Run stats: showStats\n- Keyboard shortcuts: Shift+1-9\n\nAlready implemented in js/debug.js:\n- FPS overlay with color coding\n- Debug logging (log, warn, error)\n- Toggle via 'D' key\n\n## Work Order\n\nStart with P0 issues in order (pkn.1 -\u003e pkn.2 -\u003e pkn.3) as they provide foundation.\nP1 issues can be worked in any order after P0 complete.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-17T11:32:11.622752-05:00","created_by":"joshdaws","updated_at":"2026-01-17T19:29:56.563921-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-17T19:29:56.563921-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

Large issues like \"Fix Responsive Scaling\" could involve 10+ files and multiple distinct changes. This leads to:\n- Massive PRs that are hard to review\n- Higher risk of introducing bugs\n- Harder to bisect if something breaks\n- Loss of progress if Ralph hits context limits\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd an **issue sizing step** to Ralph's workflow after claiming an issue:\n\n### New Workflow\n\n```\n1. Claim issue\n2. Read issue description\n3. **NEW: Evaluate scope**\n   - List files likely involved\n   - Estimate number of distinct changes\n   - Rate complexity (S/M/L/XL)\n4. **NEW: If L or XL, decompose first**\n   - Create sub-issues with parent relationship\n   - Each sub-issue should be S or M sized\n   - First sub-issue should be claimable immediately\n5. Work on first (or only) issue\n6. Commit, test, close\n7.

Each sub-issue should be independently testable\n2. Each sub-issue should be independently committable\n3. Sub-issues should have clear dependencies if order matters\n4.
