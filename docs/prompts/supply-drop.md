# Supply Drop Asset Prompts - Plane, Parachutes, Crates

Prompts for generating supply drop reveal mechanic assets for Scorched Earth: Synthwave Edition.

## Tool Recommendation

**Primary**: NanoBanana Pro (good for sprites and animation frames)
**Alternative**: Leonardo.ai (reliable transparency)

## Style Consistency Reference

```
Primary colors:
- Neon Pink: #FF00FF
- Electric Cyan: #00FFFF
- Deep Purple: #8B00FF
- Gold: #FFD700
- Rainbow: Animated gradient

Rarity color mapping:

## Design Notes

Supply drop assets create the unlock reveal animation sequence:
1. C-130 cargo plane flies across screen
2. Crate drops with color-coded parachute
3. Crate lands and opens to reveal tank

All assets need:
- **Synthwave military aesthetic**: Futuristic military with neon accents
- **Consistent lighting**: Left side light source
- **Transparent backgrounds**: For overlay animations
- **Clean silhouettes**: Readable against any background

## Animation Sequence Notes

### Supply Drop Animation Flow

```
Timeline:
0.0s - Plane enters from left
1.0s - Crate drops from plane
1.5s - Parachute deploys (color shows rarity)
2.5s - Crate lands
3.0s - Parachute detaches (floats up and away)
3.5s - Crate opens with light effect
4.0s - Tank revealed inside
```

### Parachute Color → Rarity Excitement

| Parachute | Rarity | Player Reaction |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| White | Common | Neutral |
| Cyan | Uncommon | Mild interest |
| Purple | Rare | Excitement |
| Gold | Epic | High excitement |
| Rainbow | Legendary | Maximum excitement |

## Batch Generation Tips

1. **Generate all parachutes in same session** for consistent canopy shape
2. **Start with white (common)** and progressively add glow/effects for higher tiers
3. **Generate crate closed and open** together for consistent styling
4. **Plane should match crate aesthetic** (same military synthwave style)
5. **Test all assets together** in mock animation before finalizing

## Post-Processing Notes

### Parachute Glow Intensity
- Common: Subtle edge glow
- Uncommon: Visible glow bloom
- Rare: Electric/spark accents
- Epic: Light rays emanating
- Legendary: Full prismatic effect

### Transparency Requirements
- All assets need clean alpha channels
- Glow effects should fade to full transparency
- No hard edges on light effects

### Animation Frame Alignment
If generating sprite sheets:
- Consistent positioning across frames
- Same base crate in all open frames
- Smooth glow intensity transitions

## Integration

After generation, place files in `assets/images/supply-drop/`:

```json
{
  "supply-drop": {
    "plane": { 
      "path": "images/supply-drop/supply-plane.png", 
      "width": 128, 
      "height": 64 
    },
    "parachute-common": { 
      "path": "images/supply-drop/parachute-white.png", 
      "width": 80, 
      "height": 64 
    },
    "parachute-uncommon": { 
      "path": "images/supply-drop/parachute-cyan.png", 
      "width": 80, 
      "height": 64

    "parachute-legendary": { 
      "path": "images/supply-drop/parachute-rainbow.png", 
      "width": 80, 
      "height": 64,
      "animated": true,
      "frames": 6
    },
    "crate": { 
      "path": "images/supply-drop/supply-crate.png", 
      "width": 64, 
      "height": 64 
    },
    "crate-open": { 
      "path": "images/supply-drop/supply-crate-open.png", 
      "width": 384, 
      "height": 64,
      "frames": 6
    }
  }
}
```

Test complete animation sequence before finalizing assets.
