# Projectile Sprite Prompts - 6 Types

Prompts for generating projectile sprites for Scorched Earth: Synthwave Edition.

## Tool Recommendation

**Primary**: NanoBanana Pro
**Alternative**: Leonardo.ai (good transparency support)

## Style Consistency Reference

```
Primary colors:
- Neon Pink: #FF00FF
- Electric Cyan: #00FFFF
- Deep Purple: #8B00FF
- Hot Orange: #FF6600

Common elements:
- Chrome/metallic surfaces
- Neon glow effects (2-4px blur)
- Energy trails
- Geometric shapes
```

## Design Notes

Projectiles are small sprites (8-16 pixels) that need:
- **Distinct silhouettes** for quick recognition at game speed
- **Bright, glowing** appearance to stand out against terrain
- **Simple geometry** that reads well at small sizes
- **Top-down or angled view** showing projectile in flight

## Batch Generation Tips

1. **Generate all projectiles in same session** for style consistency
2. **Start with largest (nuke)** to establish detail level, then simplify for smaller assets
3. **Generate 3-5 variations** of each and select clearest silhouettes
4. **Test at game resolution** - projectiles must read clearly at actual size
5. **Maintain consistent glow intensity** across all projectile types

## Color Coding Summary

| Projectile | Primary Color | Secondary |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Basic | Cyan | White |
| MIRV | Magenta/Pink | Chrome |
| Roller | Orange | Chrome |
| Digger | Purple | Cyan |
| Nuke | Yellow/Orange | Chrome |
| Mini Nuke | Green | Chrome |

## Post-Processing Notes

For small sprites like projectiles:
1. Ensure glow doesn't get cropped - may need 1px padding
2. Test contrast against dark and light terrain backgrounds
3. Consider adding subtle animation frames (pulsing glow) in future

## Integration

After generation, place files in `assets/images/weapons/`:

```json
{
  "projectiles": {
    "basic": { "path": "images/weapons/shot-basic.png", "width": 8, "height": 8 },
    "mirv": { "path": "images/weapons/shot-mirv.png", "width": 12, "height": 12 },
    "roller": { "path": "images/weapons/shot-roller.png", "width": 10, "height": 10 },
    "digger": { "path": "images/weapons/shot-digger.png", "width": 8, "height": 8 },
    "nuke": { "path": "images/weapons/shot-nuke.png", "width": 16, "height": 16 },
    "miniNuke": { "path": "images/weapons/shot-mini-nuke.png", "width": 12, "height": 12 }
  }
}
```

Test in-game rendering at actual game resolution before finalizing.
