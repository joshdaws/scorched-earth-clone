## Batch Generation Strategy

### Generation Order

1. **Start with Common tier**: Establish base consistency
2. **Progress to Uncommon**: Add color vibrancy
3. **Generate Rare**: Create themed designs
4. **Finish with Epic/Legendary**: Most complex designs

### Consistency Tips

1. **Use same base silhouette** for all tanks
2. **Generate color variants in batches** of 4-5
3. **Reference previous outputs** for style consistency
4. **Test all tanks at game resolution** (64x32)

### Animation Guidelines

- Epic tier: 4 frames, 0.2s per frame (0.8s loop)
- Legendary tier: 6 frames, 0.15s per frame (0.9s loop)
- Keep movement subtle (glow, shimmer, not major shape changes)

---

## File Naming Convention

```
tank-[name].png        - Static sprite
tank-[name]-sheet.png  - Animation sprite sheet
```

## Tank Count Summary

| Tier | Count | Animation |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Common | 15 | Static only |
| Uncommon | 12 | Static only |
| Rare | 8 | Static only |
| Epic | 5 | Optional 4-frame |
| Legendary | 4 | Optional 6-frame |
| **Total** | **44** | |

---

## Integration

After generation, place files in `assets/images/tanks/collection/`:

```json
{
  "tankCollection": {
    "common": {
      "desertCamo": { "path": "images/tanks/collection/tank-desert-camo.png", "width": 64, "height": 32 },
      "forestCamo": { "path": "images/tanks/collection/tank-forest-camo.png", "width": 64, "height": 32 }
    },
    "uncommon": {
      "neonPink": { "path": "images/tanks/collection/tank-neon-pink.png", "width": 64, "height": 32 }
    },
    "rare": {
      "delorean": { "path": "images/tanks/collection/tank-delorean.png", "width": 64, "height": 32 }
    },
    "epic": {

        "height": 32,
        "animated": true,
        "sheetPath": "images/tanks/collection/flame-rider-sheet.png",
        "frames": 4
      }
    },
    "legendary": {
      "bloodDragon": { 
        "path": "images/tanks/collection/tank-blood-dragon.png", 
        "width": 64, 
        "height": 32,
        "animated": true,

        "frames": 6
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Test all tanks in collection screen and in-game before finalizing.
