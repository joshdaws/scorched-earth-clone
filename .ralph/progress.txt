## scorched-earth-yww - Bug: Pause menu buttons not functional
**Status:** Completed
**Changes:** Fixed input.js to pass design space coordinates (pointer.x/y) instead of raw screen coordinates (mouse.x/y, touch.x/y) to event callbacks. This ensures UI hit detection works correctly regardless of canvas scaling.
**Files:** js/input.js - Updated handleMouseUp, handleMouseMove, handleTouchStart, handleTouchEnd, handleTouchMove
