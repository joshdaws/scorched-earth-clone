## 2026-01-09: scorched-earth-iug.5 - QA: Controls & Input validation
**Status:** CLOSED

### Summary
Comprehensive validation of all game controls and input methods against the spec (Section: Controls & Input, lines 107-171).

### Testing Performed
- **Desktop Controls (7/7 verified):** Arrow keys for angle/power adjustment, Tab for weapon cycling, Spacebar and FIRE button for firing, angle arc drag, power slider drag
- **Mobile/Touch Controls (6/6 code review pass):** Angry Birds-style drag aiming implementation verified via code review in touchAiming.js
- **Parameter Constraints (3/3 verified):** Angle clamped to 0-180°, power clamped to 0-100%, tested both boundaries

### Key Findings
- All controls function correctly per spec
- Hold-to-adjust pattern working for keyboard controls
- Visual feedback (trajectory preview, rubber band) implemented
- Touch aiming calculates angle from drag direction, power from drag distance

### Files Reviewed
- js/aimingControls.js - Control layout and hit detection
- js/touchAiming.js - Touch/mobile aiming implementation
- js/constants.js - Design dimensions (1200x800)
## scorched-earth-iug.6 - QA: Turn System validation
**Status:** Completed
**Changes:** Validated all turn system functionality including round start, turn structure, phase transitions, and victory/defeat conditions. All tests passed.
**Files:** No code changes - QA validation only
