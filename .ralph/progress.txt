## scorched-earth-i27 - Fix applyFallingDirt method not found error in terrain destruction
**Status:** Closed (Not a code bug - browser caching issue)
**Investigation:** 
- Confirmed `applyFallingDirt` method exists at line 337 in terrain.js
- Confirmed server serves correct file content
- Root cause: Browser ES module caching served stale terrain.js without the new method
- Resolution: Hard refresh or cache clear resolves the issue; no code changes needed
**Files:** No files modified (code was already correct)

## scorched-earth-qff.2 - Implement Screen Shake Effect
**Status:** Completed
